#Week 1

## Retrospective
What went well last year?  What went less well?  What could be done better to make this year better than last?

What would you like to do?

## Rough Outline
Move on from Scratch to learn a programming language

Python considered but going to try JavaScript as:
..*it requires less installation and maintenance (text editor and a modern browser)
..*its **very** popular and incredibly useful
..*gives us better options to distribute the amazing things we are going to make üòÅ (web hosted or wrapped in a native app... maybe) 

Would like to see you make something; some very impressive things made in Scratch last year (both creatively and technically) but Scatch was showing its limitations, if we use a more powerful toolset we should be able to make cool stuff ‚ò∫Ô∏è

We could work as a team/in multiple teams to tackle something large...

The goal is likely to make games unless you have any other ideas?
